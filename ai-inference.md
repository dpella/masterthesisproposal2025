## Company 

[DPella AB](www.dpella.io) is a deep tech startup that has developed a solution
to do privacy preserving analytics using Differential Privacy (DP) technology
(see below). DPellaâ€™s team of world experts (all with PhDs) in DP technology and
in building privacy-by-design and secure-by-design systems believe that this
technology is the best existing approach for doing privacy preserving analytics.

## Proposal 

The practice of releasing aggregated analytics is often assumed to protect
individual privacy. However, such measures can still reveal sensitive
information when combined with publicly available data. By exploiting
correlations between changes in aggregate data and external datasets,
adversaries can infer private details about individuals, even in scenarios
where no direct identifiers are present.

*Large language models (LLMs) not only simplify data analysis but can also amplify
risks when anonymized data is poorly secured.* This thesis explores the
potential for using LLMs to perform inference attacks on aggregated, and
anonymized datasets. Specifically, it examines the types of prompts that enable
LLMs to extract sensitive information, evaluates the success of these attacks
using additional public data. The findings highlight the risks associated with
poorly anonymized data in the age of AI and provide recommendations for
mitigating these risks.
